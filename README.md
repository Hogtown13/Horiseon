# Code Refactor Starter Code
This is an accessibility and CSS consolidated update to the Horiseon web page.
I have given images alt. text to help screenreaders. 
I have fixed some broken links, attached an id for an href.
There were several sections of CSS I was able to consolidate using secondary class selectors.

## Here is a screenshot of the webpage.
